                    <b>What is the band's setlist for the current tour, and are there any surprises in store for
                        fans?</b>
                    Tyler and Josh have a lot in store for their fans! They are playing songs from every album!
                    You'll hear songs from their original album, Self-Titled, Vessel, Blurryface, Trench, and their
                    new album, Scaled and Icy. There might also be some surprise songs.

                    <b>How long is the concert expected to last? Will there be any intermissions or breaks during
                        the performance?</b>
                    The concert should last about 3 hours. There is an opener who is Peter McPoland and he'll play
                    for an hour. There will be a 30-minute intermission, and Twenty One Pilots will play for about
                    two hours.
