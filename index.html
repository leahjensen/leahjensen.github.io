        Hi everyone, my name is Leah Jensen. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, but recently moved to Rexburg, Idaho for college. I'm the youngest of 3 siblings.
    <p>I'm currently majoring in communications, but am still trying to decide what I want to do. I love to travel, thrift, and hang out with friends.
